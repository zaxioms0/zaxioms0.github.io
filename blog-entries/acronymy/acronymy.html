  <p><a href="http://acronymy.net/" target="_blank">Acronymy</a>, made by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwrensha">David
      Renshaw</a>, is without
    question one of my favorite websites. It’s an Acronym Dictionary (an
    Acronymy, if you will) where users can submit their own definitions to
    words. A “definition” in this context, is a description of the word in
    question that is also an acronym of it. For example, “acronym” is
    defined as:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
      <b>A</b>
      <br>
      <b>C</b>urious
      <br>
      <b>R</b>eduction
      <br>
      <b>O</b>f
      <br>
      <b>N</b>oises
      <br>
      <b>Y</b>ou
      <br>
      <b>M</b>ade
    </div>

  <h2 id="the-graph"><span class="highlight">The Graph</span> </h2>
  <p>In order to do any analysis of Acronymy, we first need to think of a
    way to represent the data - after a bit of thought a directed graph
    seems like a reasonable choice. The graph is constructed in the
    following manner: I add a vertex for each word and draw an arrow from
    word <span class="math inline">u</span> to word <span class="math inline">v</span> if <span
      class="math inline">v</span> is
    used in word <span class="math inline">u</span>’s definition.
    Concretely, in the previous example, the graph would have arrows
    starting at the word “acronym” and ending at all the words in the
    definition. This graph is enormous - culling all the vertices with
    degree <span class="math inline">0</span> it still has about <span class="math inline">10000</span> vertices. Here
    is a visualization of
    the graph: <img src="./img/compressed_graph.png" alt="A visualization of the Acronymy graph" /></p>
  <p>Super illuminating, I know. The size of the vertices corresponds to
    their in-degree, or how many words use them in their definition. The
    vertices that are large enough to be visible are common words like “a”,
    and “the”. If you are interested, a full-resolution version of the image
    is availible <a href="https://gofile.io/d/0mWlfr" target="_blank">here</a>. The colors
    of the words are irrelevant, I used a rough heuristic to try and make
    them visible on the background, but it’s not perfect and if you have any
    ideas for how to improve it please let me know!</p>
  <h2 id="basic-analysis"> <span class="highlight">Basic Analysis</span></h2>
  <p>Naturally, I had a few questions about the graph. Some basic
    statistics about the graph. It has <span class="math inline">21159</span> edges, <span
      class="math inline">9049</span> vertices, and an average degree of <span class="math inline">4.68</span>. If you
    wanted to be able to understand
    the entire dictionary, you would need the definitions of <span class="math inline">5275</span> words, but if you
    exclude the words
    which are used in one or fewer definitions this number goes down to
    <span class="math inline">1544</span>. David then suggested looking at
    connected components of which there are <span class="math inline">21</span>. Besides the “main” one, they all have
    size less than <span class="math inline">7</span> and arise from a word
    having a defintion which has no defined words. For example, the set
    {anxiousis, remorseful, afraid, intimidated,
    alarmed, dazed, frightful} is its own connected component where “afraid”
    stands for “anxious frightful remorseful alarmed intimidated dazed” and
    none of those words are defined (at the time of writing).

  <h2 id="generalized-recursive-arcronyms"> <span class="highlight"> Recursive
      Arcronyms</span></h2>
  <p>I <strong>love</strong> recursive acronyms. Genuinely, if I ever have
    a kid (or pet or something) I will name them a recursive acronym because
    I love them so much. If you’ve had the misfortune of going your entire
    life without encountering recursive acronyms, it’s a fairly simple
    premise - it’s just an acronym in which at least one of the letters stands for
    the acronym itself. The most famous example is GNU which stands for “GNU’s not
    Unix”. I have much more to say on regular recursive acronyms, but that’s
    for another day.</p>
  <p>While working on this project, I realized Acronymy let’s you
    generalize the notion of a recursive acronym! Suppose word <span class="math inline">w</span> has a definition <span
      class="math inline">u\, v</span>. There’s nothing special going on here,
    but what if <span class="math inline">u</span> has definition <span class="math inline">w \, s</span>. Well then you
    could say that <span class="math inline">w</span> <em>actually</em> is defined as <span class="math inline">w\, s\,
      v</span> by replacing <span class="math inline">u</span> with its definition. In fact, these
    generalized recursive acronyms are exactly the cycles in the graph! With
    this information in hand, we can find a bunch of them! My personal
    favorite is “yas” stands for “<b>y</b>et <b>a</b>nother <b>s</b>lay” and “slay” stands for
    “<b>s</b>tylish, <b>l</b>avish, <b>a</b>nd <b>y</b>as”. So really, “slay”, stands for “stylish,
    lavish, and yet another stylish, lavish, and yet another…” which I think is incredibly fitting.
    This list of all “essentially unique” generalized recursive acronyms of
    length less than 10 can be found <a href="https://pastebin.com/sU6uLmHy" target="_blank">here</a>. (These might be
    outdated
    from new definitions.)</p>
  <p>It turns out that it’s very easy to make lots of generalized
    recursive acronyms by taking an existing one and changing one or two
    words to arrive at a common word. For example, we have two sequences of
    words that constitute a recursive acronym in “onward ways your you unit
    upper under retreat to” and “onward ways your you unit upper under
    retreat track to”. Including all of these is pretty boring so the list
    is filtered for acronyms which share very few words. There are <span class="math inline">1749</span> unique words
    that appear in generalized
    recursive acronyms of length less than <span class="math inline">10</span> which I think is really cool! Once every
    word is defined, we’ll have tons of generalized recursive acronyms! The
    only words that won’t be part of one is those who are used in no
    defintions - that might be rarer than the ones that are, but that’s ok I
    still think generalized recursive acronyms are cool :D</p>
  <h2 id="further-work"><span class="highlight">Further Work</span></h2>
  <p>There is much to be done in the world of acronyms! A
    not-so-surprising fact is that adjacent words in the graph are often
    similar in meaning - what would happen if we used the distance between
    two vertices as a semantic distance function? I doubt the results would
    be good, but would it be passable?</p>
  <p>Also, I would love to make the graph more readable. Any suggestions
    on how to do that would be greatly appreciated!</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading this far! If you’re interested, you can find the
    code I used to do all of this analysis <a href="https://github.com/zaxioms/acronomy-visualizer" target="_blank">on
      my github</a> (but it’s in no way
    cleaned up for use). And of course, thank you so much to David Renshaw
    for helping me along in this project and making
    Acronymy.</p>
