<h1 id="acronymy-analysis"><span class="highlight">Acronymy Analysis</span> </h1>
<p><a href="http://acronymy.net/">Acronymy</a>, made by <a
href="https://twitter.com/dwrensha">David Renshaw</a>, is without
question one of my favorite websites. It’s an Acronym Dictionary (an
Acronymy, if you will) where users can submit their own definitions to
words. A “definition” in this context, is a description of the word in
question that is also an acronym of it. For example, “acronym” is
defined as:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
    <b>A</b>
    <br>
    <b>C</b>urious
    <br>
    <b>R</b>eduction
    <br>
    <b>O</b>f
    <br>
    <b>N</b>oises
    <br>
    <b>Y</b>ou
    <br>
    <b>M</b>ade
</div>

</div>
<h2 id="the-graph"><span class="highlight">The Graph</span> </h2>
<p>In order to do any analysis of Acronymy, we first need to think of a
way to represent the data - after a bit of thought a directed graph
seems like a reasonable choice. The graph is constructed in the
following manner: I add a vertex for each word and draw an arrow from
word <span class="math inline">u</span> to word <span
class="math inline">v</span> if <span class="math inline">v</span> is
used in word <span class="math inline">u</span>’s definition.
Concretely, in the previous example, the graph would have arrows
starting at the word “acronym” and ending at all the words in the
definition. This graph is enormous - culling all the vertices with
degree <span class="math inline">0</span> it still has about <span
class="math inline">10000</span> vertices. Here is a visualization of
the graph: <img src="./img/compressed_graph.png"
alt="A visualization of the Acronymy graph" /></p>
<p>Super illuminating, I know. The size of the vertices corresponds to
their in-degree, or how many words use them in their definition. The
vertices that are large enough to be visible are common words like “a”,
and “the”. If you are interested, a full-resolution version of the image
is availible <a href="https://gofile.io/d/0mWlfr">here</a>. The colors
of the words are irrelevant, I used a rough heuristic to try and make
them visible on the background, but it’s not perfect and if you have any
ideas for how to improve it please let me know!</p>
<h2 id="basic-analysis"> <span class="highlight">Basic Analysis</span></h2>
<p>Naturally, I had a few questions about the graph. Some basic
statistics about the graph. It has <span
class="math inline">21159</span> edges, <span
class="math inline">9049</span> vertices, and an average degree of <span
class="math inline">4.68</span>. If you wanted to be able to understand
the entire dictionary, you would need the definitions of <span
class="math inline">5275</span> words, but if you exclude the words
which are used in one or fewer definitions this number goes down to
<span class="math inline">1544</span>. David then suggested looking at
connected components of which there are <span
class="math inline">21</span>. Besides the “main” one, they all have
size less than <span class="math inline">7</span> and arise from a word
having a defintion which has no defined words. For example, the set
<span class="math inline">\{\text{anxious}, \text{remorseful},
\text{afraid}, \text{intimidated}, \text{alarmed}, \text{dazed},
\text{frightful}\}</span> is its own connected component where “afraid”
stands for “anxious frightful remorseful alarmed intimidated dazed” and
none of those words are defined (at the time of writing).</p>
<h2 id="generalized-recursive-arcronyms"> <span class="highlight"> Recursive
Arcronyms</span></h2>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> recursive acronyms. Genuinely, if I ever have
a kid (or pet or something) I will name them a recursive acronym because
I love them so much. If you’ve had the misfortune of going your entire
life without encountering recursive acronyms, it’s a fairly simple
premise - it’s just an acronym in which at least one of the letters stands for
the acronym itself. The most famous example is GNU which stands for “GNU’s not
Unix”. I have much more to say on regular recursive acronyms, but that’s
for another day.</p>
<p>While working on this project, I realized Acronymy let’s you
generalize the notion of a recursive acronym! Suppose word <span
class="math inline">w</span> has a definition <span
class="math inline">u\, v</span>. There’s nothing special going on here,
but what if <span class="math inline">u</span> has definition <span
class="math inline">w \, s</span>. Well then you could say that <span
class="math inline">w</span> <em>actually</em> is defined as <span
class="math inline">w\, s\, v</span> by replacing <span
class="math inline">u</span> with its definition. In fact, these
generalized recursive acronyms are exactly the cycles in the graph! With
this information in hand, we can find a bunch of them! My personal
favorite is “yas” stands for “<b>y</b>et <b>a</b>nother <b>s</b>lay” and “slay” stands for
“<b>s</b>tylish, <b>l</b>avish, <b>a</b>nd <b>y</b>as”. So really, “slay”, stands for “stylish,
lavish, and yet another stylish, lavish, and yet another…” which I think is incredibly fitting.
This list of all “essentially unique” generalized recursive acronyms of
length less than 10 can be found <a
href="https://pastebin.com/UUSMnpjc">here</a>. (These might be outdated
from new definitions.)</p>
<p>It turns out that it’s very easy to make lots of generalized
recursive acronyms by taking an existing one and changing one or two
words to arrive at a common word. For example, we have two sequences of
words that constitute a recursive acronym in “onward ways your you unit
upper under retreat to” and “onward ways your you unit upper under
retreat track to”. Including all of these is pretty boring so the list
is filtered for acronyms which share very few words. There are <span
class="math inline">1749</span> unique words that appear in generalized
recursive acronyms of length less than <span
class="math inline">10</span> which I think is really cool! Once every
word is defined, we’ll have tons of generalized recursive acronyms! The
only words that won’t be part of one is those who are used in no
defintions - that might be rarer than the ones that are, but that’s ok I
still think generalized recursive acronyms are cool :D</p>
<h2 id="further-work"><span class="highlight">Further Work</span></h2>
<p>There is much to be done in the world of acronyms! A
not-so-surprising fact is that adjacent words in the graph are often
similar in meaning - what would happen if we used the distance between
two vertices as a semantic distance function? I doubt the results would
be good, but would it be passable?</p>
<p>Also, I would love to make the graph more readable. Any suggestions
on how to do that would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! If you’re interested, you can find the
code I used to do all of this analysis <a
href="https://github.com/zaxioms/acronomy-visualizer">on my github</a> (but it’s in no way
cleaned up for use). And of course, thank you so much to David Renshaw
for helping me along in this project and making
Acronymy.</p>
