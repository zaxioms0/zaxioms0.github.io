    <h2 id="tldr"><span class="highlight">What is Hexamaze?</span></h2>
    The Game <a href="">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</a> (KTANE) involves cooperatively solving a series of puzzles
    in order to defuse a bomb.
    In the game, the player with the bomb needs to relay information presented to them in the module to the other player
    who has the manual on how to
    defuse the bomb. Notably, the defuser cannot see the manual, and the player with the manual cannot see the bomb.
    <br>
    <br>
    In hexamaze, the defuser is presented with a small hexagonal grid with a few icons on it and a colored peg. The
    defuser then must convey the relative
    positions of the symbols on the hexagonal grid to the player with the manual. In the manual, there is a larger
    hexagonal grid, which contains the small
    one that the player sees, up to rotation. It is then the goal of the manual player to align the small subgrid that
    the defuser has to the large grid in the manual
    and instruct the defuser how to guide the peg out of the maze.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the example below, the highlighted blue section on the rightmost image is the subgrid that the defuser sees,
    correctly overlayed on the grid
    that the manual user sees, as conveyed by the circle, hexagon, and triangle indicators which need to line up.
    <div id="figure">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>

                </td>
                <td>

            <tr>

                <td>What the manual user sees</td>
                <td>The subgrid properly alligned to the large grid</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <h2 id="mathy"><span class="highlight">Making it Mathy</span> </h2>
    Finding the correct orientation of the maze wasn't so hard, right? From this game arises a natural question, or at
    least it did to my friends and I:
    "what is the hardest you can make a hexamaze?". In order to keep things interesting, tractible, and explainable
    without going too much more into the details of KTANE,
    we will make some simplifying assumptions:
    <ol>
        <li>The board will be a square</li>
        <li>The symbols will be arrows facing up, down, left, or right, or are blank.</li>
        <li>The "defuser" will see a <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> subgrid of the board.</li>
    </ol>
    To formally state the problem: You are tasked with filling in a <span class="math inline">n \times n</span> board
    with symbols, <span class="math inline">\{\uparrow, \downarrow, \rightarrow, \leftarrow, \quad\}</span>, in each
    cell such that every <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> subgrid
    is unique up to rotation. What is the largest value of <span class="math inline">n</span> for which this is
    possible? For simplicity a "tile" will refer to a
    <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> subgrid, and a "cell" will refer to a single square in the grid.
    <h2 id="ub"><span class="highlight">A Quick Upperbound</span> </h2>
    For the sake of example, we can demonstrate the following upperbound. The board cannot be larger than <span
        class="math inline"> 26 \times 26</span>.
    To see why, consider that there are <span class="math inline">5</span> (up, down, left, right, blank) symbols that
    can be placed on the board, and
    <span class="math inline">4</span> squares
    that the user sees. Thus, if we ignore rotation, there are <span class="math inline">5^4</span> unique <span
        class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> patterns.
    On a <span class="math inline">26 \times 26</span> board, there are <span class="math inline">25 \times 25 =
        5^4</span>, <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> subgrids,
    and thus, if the board were any larger we would run out of unique <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> tiles
    to place on the board.
    <h2 id="ub_better"><span class="highlight">Doing a Bit Better</span> </h2>
    From here, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Burnside's_lemma">Burnside's lemma</a> was discussed as potentially
    being useful. Burnside's lemma describes the number of orbits when a group <span class="math inline">G</span> acts
    on a set <span class="math inline">X</span>
    <div class=""></div>
    <span class="math display">\vert X / G \vert = \frac{1}{\vert G\vert} \sum_{g \in G} \vert \{x \in X \mid g \cdot x
        = x\} \vert</span>
    <br>
    To utilize this, we let <span class="math inline">X</span> be the set of configurations of a <span
        class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> tile, and
    <span class="math inline">G = \{e, \circlearrowright, \circlearrowright^2, \circlearrowright^3\}</span> be the
    cyclic group of order <span class="math inline">4</span> where
    the action in question is rotation clockwise by <span class="math inline">90^\circ</span> .
    For example (with colors added to make the rotation more apparent) we have:
    <span class="math display"> \circlearrowright^3 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \blue{\uparrow} & \green{\downarrow} \\ \red{\rightarrow} &
        \purple{\leftarrow}\end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix} \green{\rightarrow} & \purple{\downarrow} \\ \blue{\leftarrow} & \red{\uparrow} \end{bmatrix}
    </span>
    Applying the theorem, we count the fixed points under each rotation:
    <ol>
        <li>Under no rotation, everything is fixed, so this adds <span class="math inline">5^4</span> to our sum</li>
        <li>Under clockwise rotation by <span class="math inline">90^\circ</span>, the only fixed points are the square
            of
            all blanks and the rotations of the square <span class="math inline">\begin{bmatrix} \uparrow & \rightarrow
                \\ \leftarrow & \downarrow \end{bmatrix}</span>
            which all together will add <span class="math inline">1 + 4 = 5</span> to the sum.
        </li>
        <li>Under a <span class="math inline">180^\circ</span> rotation, we see that we can fix two tiles, and then the
            other two will automatically be fixed.
            This results in an additional <span class="math inline">5^2 = 25</span> to the sum.
        </li>
        <li>
            For <span class="math inline">270^\circ</span>, the same reasoning as <span
                class="math inline">90^\circ</span> applies leaving us with another <span class="math inline">5</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    This means, all together, there are <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}\left(5^4 + 5 + 5^2 + 5\right) = 165</span>
    orbits, or,
    <span class="math inline">165</span> tiles up to rotation!
    <br>
    <br>
    This means that we cannot have a <span class="math inline">14 \times 14</span> board or larger, as this will have
    <span class="math inline">169</span>,
    <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> tiles which will require us to use a duplicate. This is a massive
    improvement on our <span class="math inline">26 \times 26</span>
    bound from before!
    <h2 id="SAT"><span class="highlight">Constructing the Best Board</span></h2>
    I must confess, the story I've told so far all took place before I was brought onto the problem. This all happened
    over the course of a math club
    dinner which I didn't attend. However, during that dinner, despite quickly finding the upperbound via the methods I
    described above, they unsurprisingly found
    constructing boards with no duplicate tiles turns out to be very difficult by hand. As such, whether <span
        class="math inline">14</span> was a tight bound remained a mystery, was it even possible to build a 
        <span class="math inline">13 \times 13</span> board under the constraints?
    Hearing about the discussion of this problem in a Discord call later that night, I thought I could help with my
    favorite tool: SAT Solvers.
    <br>
    <br>
    This blog assumes knowledge of what SAT and SAT solvers are. A quick summary can be found on <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver">Wikipedia</a>.

    While this problem seems quite complicated to encode, it is actually not too difficult. After a bit of thinking, I
    encoded the problem with the following procedure:
    <ol>
        <li>Each square has <span class="math inline">5</span> variables, one for each symbol</li>
        <li>Every <span class="math inline">2 \times 2</span> combination tile of variables implies exactly one of <span
                class="math inline">165</span> "equivalence class" variables associted with the tile</li>
        <li>There must be at most one of each class of equivalence class variables set accross all of the tiles.</li>
    </ol>
    I should add, by this point it was around 4am and I had just come home from a night in New York City, so I was
    exhausted. I wasn't really considering how to optimally encode
    the problem - I just wanted to see what would happen if I tried a naive strategy - I could improve it tomorrow
    morning. With my encoding scheme, for a <span class="math inline">13 \times
        13</span> board, this encoding results in <span class="math inline">(13^2 * 5) + (12^2 * 165) = 24605</span>
    problem variables.
    At first, when I saw this I was a bit disheartened - I was too tired to implement any clever encoding of the
    cardinality constraints, and knowing the naive encoding I cooked up
    would be roughly <span class="math inline">O(n^2)</span> clauses, I felt I should probably go to bed and come back
    to the problem in the morning. But, something in me pushed me to try it
    anyway. And to my surprise, despite the tragically large number of clauses, <span class="math inline">1795739</span>
    to be exact, cadical spit out an answer almost immediately!
    <br>
    <br>
    It turned out a <span class="math inline">13 \times 13</span> board was possible! I quickly wrote a script to decode
    the output from cadical, and my sleep deprived brain couldn't believe its eyes.
