    <h1 id="main"><span class="highlight">The Great Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Adventure</span> </h1>
    I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 2 years at the time of writing, and like any self-respecting
    Computer Science major, I've spent the vast majority of that time inside. That is, until I learned
    a few days ago about the wonders of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP) and their Passport system.
    When you get a library card at the CLP, they give you a "CLP passport" -
    a passport in which you can keep track of the libraries you've visited marked with a large stamp, much
    like the ones on a regular passport. Immediately, I was fascinated by this, and the little gamer inside
    my head was urging me to "100%" the passport and visit every library (I had to talk myself out of speedrunning it,
    more on that later).
    On this page I plan to keep updated my journey across Pittsburgh's libraries, complete with blurbs about progress.
    The only rule I'm
    enforcing is that I may only travel to libraries via public transportation. Let the Great Carnegie Library of
    Pittsburgh Adventure Commence!

                    A bit of an underwhelming library. It's too big to be cozy, but too small to have
                    the majestic feel of Squirrel Hill or Oakland. I went with my friend Xander which was
                    really fun though! There isn't enough around the library to make the trip worth it.
                    To be honest the picture I think it makes it look nicer than it actually feels,
                    but maybe it was having an off-day. Who knows?
                    Not a bad library by any means, but nothing super notable. Solid B tier.

                    <p>
                        Today I went to Sheraden's library, the farthest I've traveled to a library so far (and probably
                        overall).
                        I had a good amount of time this afternoon and I needed to solve an algorithms problem so I
                        figured
                        I might
                        as well make the bus trip out here and try to solve the problem on the way.
                        I have a lot to say on this library, so I suppose I'll start with the superficial stuff. The
                        library
                        is fairly small, consisting of only one main room, but that doesn't detract from its overall
                        quality.
                        If you're looking for a specific book or piece of media, maybe this library isn't the one for
                        you,
                        but it has a great selection nonetheless. It's occurring to me I haven't talked about the books
                        I've
                        read
                        on these trips, which as you may know, is what libraries are famous for. While here, I read the
                        first chapter
                        of a book called
                        <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/06/964567998/a-journalists-eye-enlivens-land-of-big-numbers"
                            target="_blank">
                            Land of Big Numbers </a> by Te-Ping Chen. While admittedly I picked it up hoping it might
                        be a statistical take on the genre of classics like <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland" target="_blank">Flatland</a>
                        due to the title's similarity to the "Law of Large Numbers", I was surprised at how captivated I
                        was
                        by the first chapter.
                        It managed to set up the story of two twins with diverging lives in modern China in a
                        surprisingly
                        enchanting way - Chen's
                        writing style may not be the most unique in the world, but it has an almost whimsical feeling
                        that
                        contrats the bleak
                        subject matter. I also read volume two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man"
                            target="_blank">Chainsaw Man</a>
                        which was fun as expected. I wish they has volume three, but it's checked out right now. Lastly,
                        the teenspace flags, which are slowly seeming to be a staple of CLPs, were mostly the same.
                        The pizza was gone, replaced with a checkerboard pattern, and the yellow monster was back.
                        I wonder if there's any lore to them.

                    <p>
                        But, truth be told there's so much about this library that I loved which goes far beyond
                        it's slightly run-down appearence as compared to the other libraries I've visited.
                        I should preface this by saying that I am in no way whatsoever qualified to talk on
                        socioeconomics, but I feel like I have to touch on it. Sheraden, to be blunt,
                        is a low income neighborhood. Taking information from <a
                            href="https://pittsburghneighborhoodproject.blog/2019/07/05/neighborhood-profiles-sheraden-and-esplen/"
                            target="_blank">
                            The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project
                        </a>, in 2017, 29% of residents were below the national poverty line and it
                        "ranked number 1 in 2017 regarding aggravated assault with a weapon in raw incidents."
                        The school system is not great either, only offering a public K through 8 education.
                        At the main school <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/pittsburgh-langley-k-8-pittsburgh-pa/"
                            target="_blank">
                            Langley K-8
                        </a>, only 12% of students are proficient in reading and 4% in math, as determined by state
                        testing.
                        But, despite that, I'm sitting in a library where kids and teens are hanging out all reading and
                        playing together. The library is packed to the brim with books to study for college entrance
                        exams
                        for students who want it - and the library is not shy about its numerous programs for students
                        to read and learn together. Sitting here, I've noticed that every employee knows the name of
                        every
                        person that walks through the doors - no exageration whatsoever. It's obvious that there's a
                        community built around this library - a place for the residents of Sheraden to hang out
                        and spend time together. In reading about Sheraden to write this blog, the word I kept
                        seeing pop up was "community" and it's easy to see why. Sheraden library gets an easy A tier
                        for that alone.

                            A really fantastic library! It has really great, cozy vibes once you get past the entrance
                            up a bunch of stairs which seems like they might be being rennovated. The building itself is
                            a really great piece of architecture and is a notable landmark on the bus ride from CMU so I
                            never
                            miss my Squirrel Hill stop. The library itself has a great collection of books and
                            multimedia.
                            I really appreciated the little displays they put up for notable books/genres. They had a
                            Teenspace
                            - I dared not step into to preserve its teenage sanctity - which had graphics on the window
                            of
                            my three favorite things from when I was a teenager: a yellow monster, pizza, and queer
                            pride.
                            I hope the teenagers of Squirrel Hill make good use of this place! The children's section
                            was
                            notably cute - I really appreciate them having computers dedicated for kids to use. I'm sure
                            some future CS major will have gotten their start from these computers and the intro
                            programming
                            books nearby. And of course, shoutout to Nibbles to Squirrel.

                                Where better to start the journey than at the Main Library! (Conviniently also the
                                closest
                                by
                                distance)
                                It has everything you could possibly want in a library: tons of study space, books and
                                other
                                media
                                to checkout galore,
                                a really nice coffee shop (I recommend the chocolate-banana muffin). The building itself
                                is
                                gorgeous
                                - I like to go
                                to the second floor to study. Also, I ran into my friend Sasha when visiting for the
                                first
                                time,
                                so
                                that's a plus!
                                The only downside of this library is that the rooms are very echoey, so it's easy to
                                accidentally be
                                very loud and disturb
                                people when shuffling through a bag, for example. However, it's easily an S tier
                                library,
                                highly
                                recommended.
