    <h1 id="main"><span class="highlight">The Great Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Adventure</span> </h1>
    I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 2 years at the time of writing, and like any self-respecting
    Computer Science major, I've spent the vast majority of that time inside. That is, until I learned
    a few days ago about the wonders of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP) and their Passport system.
    When you get a library card at the CLP, they give you a "CLP passport" -
    a passport in which you can keep track of the libraries you've visited marked with a large stamp, much
    like the ones on a regular passport. Immediately, I was fascinated by this, and the little gamer inside
    my head was urging me to "100%" the passport and visit every library (I had to talk myself out of speedrunning it,
    more on that later).
    On this page I plan to keep updated my journey across Pittsburgh's libraries, complete with blurbs about progress.
    The only rule I'm
    enforcing is that I may only travel to libraries via public transportation. Let the Great Carnegie Library of
    Pittsburgh Adventure Commence!

                <p>
                    Today I went to Sheraden's library, the farthest I've traveled to a library so far (and probably
                    overall).
                    I had a good amount of time this afternoon and I needed to solve an algorithms problem so I figured
                    I might
                    as well make the bus trip out here and try to solve the problem on the way.
                    I have a lot to say on this library, so I suppose I'll start with the superficial stuff. The library
                    is fairly small, consisting of only one main room, but that doesn't detract from its overall
                    quality.
                    If you're looking for a specific book or piece of media, maybe this library isn't the one for you,
                    but it has a great selection nonetheless. It's occurring to me I haven't talked about the books I've
                    read
                    on these trips, which as you may know, is what libraries are famous for. While here, I read the
                    first chapter
                    of a book called
                    <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/06/964567998/a-journalists-eye-enlivens-land-of-big-numbers"
                        target="_blank">
                        Land of Big Numbers </a> by Te-Ping Chen. While admittedly I picked it up hoping it might
                    be a statistical take on the genre of classics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"
                        target="_blank">Flatland</a>
                    due to the title's similarity to the "Law of Large Numbers", I was surprised at how captivated I was
                    by the first chapter.
                    It managed to set up the story of two twins with diverging lives in modern China in a surprisingly
                    enchanting way - Chen's
                    writing style may not be the most unique in the world, but it has an almost whimsical feeling that
                    contrats the bleak
                    subject matter. I also read volume two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man"
                        target="_blank">Chainsaw Man</a>
                    which was fun as expected. I wish they has volume three, but it's checked out right now. Lastly,
                    the teenspace flags, which are slowly seeming to be a staple of CLPs, were mostly the same.
                    The pizza was gone, replaced with a checkerboard pattern, and the yellow monster was back.
                    I wonder if there's any lore to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, truth be told there's so much about this library that I loved which goes far beyond
                    it's slightly run-down appearence as compared to the other libraries I've visited.
                    I should preface this by saying that I am in no way whatsoever qualified to talk on
                    socioeconomics, but I feel like I have to touch on it. Sheraden, to be blunt,
                    is a low income neighborhood. Taking information from <a
                        href="https://pittsburghneighborhoodproject.blog/2019/07/05/neighborhood-profiles-sheraden-and-esplen/"
                        target="_blank">
                        The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project
                    </a>, in 2017, 29% of residents were below the national poverty line and it
                    "ranked number 1 in 2017 regarding aggravated assault with a weapon in raw incidents."
                    The school system is not great either, only offering a public K through 8 education.
                    At the main school <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/pittsburgh-langley-k-8-pittsburgh-pa/"
                        target="_blank">
                        Langley K-8
                    </a>, only 12% of students are proficient in reading and 4% in math, as determined by state testing.
                    But, despite that, I'm sitting in a library where kids and teens are hanging out all reading and
                    playing together. The library is packed to the brim with books to study for college entrance exams
                    for students who want it - and the library is not shy about its numerous programs for students
                    to read and learn together. Sitting here, I've noticed that every employee knows the name of every
                    person that walks through the doors - no exageration whatsoever. It's obvious that there's a
                    community built around this library - a place for the residents of Sheraden to hang out
                    and spend time together. In reading about Sheraden to write this blog, the word I kept
                    seeing pop up was "community" and it's easy to see why. Sheraden library gets an easy A tier
                    for that alone.

                        A really fantastic library! It has really great, cozy vibes once you get past the entrance
                        up a bunch of stairs which seems like they might be being rennovated. The building itself is
                        a really great piece of architecture and is a notable landmark on the bus ride from CMU so I
                        never
                        miss my Squirrel Hill stop. The library itself has a great collection of books and multimedia.
                        I really appreciated the little displays they put up for notable books/genres. They had a
                        Teenspace
                        - I dared not step into to preserve its teenage sanctity - which had graphics on the window of
                        my three favorite things from when I was a teenager: a yellow monster, pizza, and queer pride.
                        I hope the teenagers of Squirrel Hill make good use of this place! The children's section was
                        notably cute - I really appreciate them having computers dedicated for kids to use. I'm sure
                        some future CS major will have gotten their start from these computers and the intro programming
                        books nearby. And of course, shoutout to Nibbles to Squirrel.

                            Where better to start the journey than at the Main Library! (Conviniently also the closest
                            by
                            distance)
                            It has everything you could possibly want in a library: tons of study space, books and other
                            media
                            to checkout galore,
                            a really nice coffee shop (I recommend the chocolate-banana muffin). The building itself is
                            gorgeous
                            - I like to go
                            to the second floor to study. Also, I ran into my friend Sasha when visiting for the first
                            time,
                            so
                            that's a plus!
                            The only downside of this library is that the rooms are very echoey, so it's easy to
                            accidentally be
                            very loud and disturb
                            people when shuffling through a bag, for example. However, it's easily an S-tier library,
                            highly
                            recommended.
